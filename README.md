# AIVirtualMouse
AI Virtual Mouse is a software that allows users to give inputs of a mouse to the system without using the actual mouse. The virtual mouse uses a web camera with the help of different image processing techniques. Using figures detection methods for instant Camera access and a user-friendly interface makes it more easily accessible. The system is used to implement a motion-tracking mouse, a physical mouse that saves time and also reduces effort. The hand movements of a user are mapped into mouse inputs. A web camera is set to take images continuously.
